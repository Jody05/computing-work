Mr Ong has a way of teaching; 
it's fun and full of life. 
He often talks about atoms and molecules; 
although sometimes we sigh.
Not to mention kahoot;
Where he bobs to the beat of the boot;
I think the effort he puts in is tremendous;
everyone should know why.
I think he that he is the best, 
his special ways of engaging us saturates our brains; 
allowing us to never forget why.ðŸ˜Ž
