Mr Ong has a way of teaching; 
it's fun and full of life. 
He talks about atoms and molecules; 
although we sometimes sigh.
i do think this line above can be added with something more than atoms and molecules?
I think the effort he puts in is tremendous;
there are no doubts asking why.
this kinda sound weird
I think we all like him, 
his way of engaging us is funny; 
and we wouldn't forget why.
